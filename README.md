## 📌 Project Overview

In this FinTech analytics project, I analyzed transactional and behavioral data of 68,000+ credit card customers to uncover:

- ₹1.9 Crore revenue leakage from dormant users
- 67% customers labeled as "Low Spenders" contributing majority of revenue
- 28.9% of customers eligible for cross-sell campaigns
- Opportunities to increase Net Interest Income and reduce late fee dependency

> This project demonstrates how data analytics can directly impact business strategy and profitability.
